    "\n",
    "[Back to Top](#toc)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An amortizing loan is a type of loan in which the borrower makes regular payments consisting of both principal and interest. These payments are designed to fully repay the loan by the end of its term. One common example of an amortizing loan is a fixed-rate mortgage for buying a home.\n",
    "\n",
    "An amortization schedule is a detailed table that outlines each payment on an amortizing loan, including the portion that goes toward paying off the principal amount and the portion that covers the interest. This schedule helps borrowers understand how their loan balance decreases over time. You can find more details [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/amortization.asp#toc-what-is-amortization) if you are interested. \n",
    "\n",
    "### &#9989;&nbsp; Question 4.1 (12 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to create a Python program that generates an amortization schedule for a loan of \\$30,000 with an annual interest rate of 3% over a 4-year period. The program should print out the amortization schedule, including the amount of interest, the amount of payment towards the principal, and the remaining loan balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula for Monthly Payment:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The monthly payment on an amortizing loan can be calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ M = \\frac{P \\cdot r \\cdot (1 + r)^N}{(1 + r)^N - 1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "- $M$ is the monthly payment.\n",
    "- $P$ is the principal loan amount (in this case, \\$ 30,000).\n",
    "- $r$ is the monthly interest rate, the annual interest rate divided by the number of months in a year.\n",
    "- $N$ is the total number of monthly payments (in this case, the loan term in months).\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of interest paid in each monthly installment is obtained by multiplying the remaining balance times the monthly interest rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your program should generate an amortization schedule with numbers rounded to 2 decimal places. Here is a sample output\n",

However, dictionaries differ in that we refer to each element by a **key** rather than an integer index. For example, in the dictionary `example_dict` in the cell below, the key string `\"red\"` corresponds to the **value** integer `-2`, the key string `\"green\"` corresponds to the value string `\"beach_ball\"`. We can include values of different types in the same dictionary, just as we did with lists above.\n",
