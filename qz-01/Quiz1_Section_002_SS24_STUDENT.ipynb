    "## Goals and Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this quiz is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed thus far this semester. In particular, you'll reflect on what you know about writing code using Python and showcase some of your new programming skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about using online resources**: This exam is \"open internet\". That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However, the use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**You cannot use ChatGPT or any other artificial intelligence tool. If you do you get 0 points!!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do your own work.** This quiz is designed to give *you* the opportunity to show the instructor what you can do and you should hold yourself accountable for maintaining a high level of academic integrity. Any violation of academic integrity could result in you receiving a zero on the quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a total of **30 points** possible on this quiz and each part of the quiz can be done independently. **If you get stuck _move on to another part of the quiz to earn some points there!_**\n",
